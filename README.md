# Last Active User ETL upsert method

Description: 
I have learn two ways to proceed the upsert method (insert + update) with last_active_user metric through python and SQL. It serves with different purpose depend on the destination source. For example, we want to transfers the executed result from last_active_user to db. Through python, we can use temp_table to extract the latest active and insert it into the table using SQL (INSERT INTO DO UPDATE).
